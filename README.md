# Zen Carriere's Portfolio Website Checkpoint

Welcome to my portfolio website repo. To access the site all you'll have to do is pull it down and run the index page from a text editor like vs code!

The html and css/sass is nearly complete. Tweaks and changes will be made based on your feedback. 

The content on the pages is still to be finalized to include projects from this semester as well.

css animations may be included if I finish every other aspect I want to see finished.

JS is semi set up to place content from a few data files, so far the data is retrieved but not placed.
