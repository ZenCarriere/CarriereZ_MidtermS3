        <div id="aboutText">
            <p>I'm Zen, an Interactive Media Design student at Fanshawe College. My passion for web design began in 
            high school when I took a computer programming class for an easy grade. To my surprise I wound up
            loving the mix of creativity and craft that goes into designing and making websites. Though I actually 
            started College in Fanshawe's Computer Programmer Analyst program I quickly found that I needed a 
            more creative outlet for my career. I love simplistic and natural shape driven design (as you can probably
            tell) but I'm always pushing myself to experiment and play around with new design concepts. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not studying hard to become the best web developer I can be I'm having fun with other creative 
            pursuits. I'm a massive fan of the arts in all its forms whether it be film, music, literature, or pretty much 
            any other art form you can think of. I love finding inspiration for my work through art in even the most 
            unexpected places. 
            </p>
